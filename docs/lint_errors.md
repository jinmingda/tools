# Linting Errors

This page contains detailed descriptions of the tests done by the [nf-core/tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) package. Linting errors should show URLs next to any failures that link to the relevant heading below.

## Error #1 - File not found / must be removed ## {#1}

nf-core pipelines should adhere to a common file structure for consistency.

The lint test looks for the following required files:

* `nextflow.config`
  * The main nextflow config file
* `Dockerfile`
  * A docker build script to generate a docker image with the required software
* Continuous integration tests with either [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/)
  * GitHub actions workflows for CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), branch protection (`.github/workflows/branch.yml`) and linting (`.github/workflows/linting.yml`)
  * Alternatively, `.travis.yml` continuous integration testing is still allowed but will be deprecated in the near future
* `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `LICENCE.md` or `LICENCE.md`
  * The MIT licence. Copy from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/tools/master/LICENSE).
* `README.md`
  * A well written readme file in markdown format
* `CHANGELOG.md`
  * A markdown file listing the changes for each pipeline release
* `docs/README.md`, `docs/output.md` and `docs/usage.md`
  * A `docs` directory with an index `README.md`, usage and output documentation

The following files are suggested but not a hard requirement. If they are missing they trigger a warning:

* `main.nf`
  * It's recommended that the main workflow script is called `main.nf`
* `conf/base.config`
  * A `conf` directory with at least one config called `base.config`

Additionally, the following files must not be present:

* `Singularity`

## Error #2 - Docker file check failed ## {#2}

Pipelines should have a files called `Dockerfile` in their root directory.
The file is used for automated docker image builds. This test checks that the file
exists and contains at least the string `FROM` (`Dockerfile`).

## Error #3 - Licence check failed ## {#3}

nf-core pipelines must ship with an open source [MIT licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

This test fails if the following conditions are not met:

* No licence file found
  * `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `LICENCE.md` or `LICENCE.md`
* Licence file contains fewer than 4 lines of text
* File does not contain the string `without restriction`
* Licence contains template placeholders
  * `[year]`, `[fullname]`, `<YEAR>`, `<COPYRIGHT HOLDER>`, `<year>` or `<copyright holders>`

## Error #4 - Nextflow config check failed ## {#4}

nf-core pipelines are required to be configured with a minimal set of variable
names. This test fails or throws warnings if required variables are not set.

> **Note:** These config variables must be set in `nextflow.config` or another config
> file imported from there. Any variables set in nextflow script files (eg. `main.nf`)
> are not checked and will be assumed to be missing.

The following variables fail the test if missing:

* `params.outdir`
  * A directory in which all pipeline results should be saved
* `manifest.name`
  * The pipeline name. Should begin with `nf-core/`
* `manifest.description`
  * A description of the pipeline
* `manifest.version`
  * The version of this pipeline. This should correspond to a [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).
* `manifest.nextflowVersion`
  * The minimum version of Nextflow required to run the pipeline.
  * Should `>=` a version number, eg. `manifest.nextflowVersion = '>=0.31.0'` (check the [Nexftlow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#scope-manifest) for more.)
  * This should correspond to the `NXF_VER` version tested by Travis.
* `manifest.homePage`
  * The homepage for the pipeline. Should be the nf-core GitHub repository URL,
    so beginning with `https://github.com/nf-core/`
* `timeline.enabled`, `trace.enabled`, `report.enabled`, `dag.enabled`
  * The nextflow timeline, trace, report and DAG should be enabled by default
* `process.cpus`, `process.memory`, `process.time`
  * Default CPUs, memory and time limits for tasks

The following variables throw warnings if missing:

* `manifest.mainScript`
  * The filename of the main pipeline script (recommended to be `main.nf`)
* `timeline.file`, `trace.file`, `report.file`, `dag.file`
  * Default filenames for the timeline, trace and report
  * Should be set to a results folder, eg: `${params.outdir}/pipeline_info/trace.[workflowname].txt"`
  * The DAG file path should end with `.svg`
    * If Graphviz is not installed, Nextflow will generate a `.dot` file instead
* `process.container`
  * Dockerhub handle for a single default container for use by all processes.
  * Must specify a tag that matches the pipeline version number if set.
  * If the pipeline version number contains the string `dev`, the dockerhub tag must be `:dev`
* `params.reads`
  * Input parameter to specify input data (typically FastQ files / pairs)
* `params.single_end`
  * Specify to work with single-end sequence data instead of paired-end by default
  * Nextflow implementation: `.fromFilePairs( params.reads, size: params.single_end ? 1 : 2 )`

The following variables are depreciated and fail the test if they are still present:

* `params.version`
  * The old method for specifying the pipeline version. Replaced by `manifest.version`
* `params.nf_required_version`
  * The old method for specifying the minimum Nextflow version. Replaced by `manifest.nextflowVersion`
* `params.container`
  * The old method for specifying the dockerhub container address. Replaced by `process.container`
* `singleEnd` and `igenomesIgnore`
  * Changed to `single_end` and `igenomes_ignore`
  * The `snake_case` convention should now be used when defining pipeline parameters

## Error #5 - Continuous Integration configuration ## {#5}

nf-core pipelines must have CI testing with GitHub actions or Travis.

This test fails if the following requirements are not met:

For GitHub actions CI workflow:

* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` must be turned on for `push` and `pull_request``
* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` must test with the minimum Nextflow version specified in the pipline as `manifest.nextflowVersion` under `jobs`, `test`, `strategy`, `matrix`, `nxf_ver`. E.g.:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
        strategy:
            matrix:
                # Nextflow versions: check pipeline minimum and current latest
                nxf_ver: ['19.10.0', '']
    ```

* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` must pull the container with the command `docker pull <container>:dev && docker tag <container>:dev <container>:<tag>` under `jobs`,`test`,`steps`. E.g. for nfcore/tools container:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
        steps:
        - name: Pull image
            run: |
            docker pull nfcore/tools:dev && docker tag nfcore/tools:dev nfcore/tools:1.0.0
    ```

* `.github/workflows/branch.yml` must be turned on for pull requests to `master`
* `.github/workflows/branch.yml` must check that PRs are only ok if coming from an nf-core `dev` branch or a fork `patch` branch. E.g. for nf-core/tools:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      # PRs are only ok if coming from an nf-core `dev` branch or a fork `patch` branch
      - name: Check PRs
        run: |
          { [[ $(git remote get-url origin) == *nf-core/tools ]] && [[ ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF} = "dev" ]]; } || [[ ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF} == "patch" ]]
    ```

* `.github/workflows/linting.yml` must be turned on for push and pull requests
* `.github/workflows/linting.yml` must perform markdown linting with the command `markdownlint ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE} -c ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/.github/markdownlint.yml` under `jobs`, `Markdown`, `steps`.
* `.github/workflows/linting.yml` must perform nf-core linting with the command `nf-core lint ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}` under `jobs`, `nf-core`, `steps`.

For Travis CI:

* `.travis.yml` must contain the string `nf-core lint ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}` under `script`
* `.travis.yml` must contain the string `docker pull <container>:dev` under `before_install`
  * Where `<container>` is fetched from `process.container` in the `nextflow.config` file, without the docker tag _(if we have the tag the tests fail when making a release)_
* `.travis.yml` must test the Nextflow version specified in the pipeline as `manifest.nextflowVersion`
  * This is expected in the `env` section of the config, eg:

    ```yaml
    env:
      - NXF_VER=0.27.0
      - NXF_VER=''
    ```

  * At least one of these `NXF_VER` variables must match the `manifest.nextflowVersion` version specified in the pipeline config
  * Other variables can be specified on these lines as long as they are space separated.
* `.travis.yml` must check that pull requests are not opened directly to the `master` branch
  * The following is expected in the `before_install` section:

    ```yaml
    before_install:
      - '[ $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST = "false" ] || [ $TRAVIS_BRANCH != "master" ] || ([ $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SLUG = $TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG ] && ([ $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH = "dev" ] || [ $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH = "patch" ]))'
    ```

## Error #6 - Repository `README.md` tests ## {#6}

The `README.md` files for a project are very important and must meet some requirements:

* Nextflow badge
  * If no Nextflow badge is found, a warning is given
  * If a badge is found but the version doesn't match the minimum version in the config file, the test fails
  * Example badge code:

    ```markdown
    [![Nextflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/nextflow-%E2%89%A50.27.6-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.nextflow.io/)
    ```

* Bioconda badge
  * If your pipeline contains a file called `environment.yml`, a bioconda badge is required
  * Required badge code:

    ```markdown
    [![install with bioconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-bioconda-brightgreen.svg)](http://bioconda.github.io/)
    ```

## Error #7 - Pipeline and container version numbers ## {#7}

> This test only runs when `--release` is set or `$TRAVIS_BRANCH` is equal to `master`

These tests look at `process.container` and `$TRAVIS_TAG`, only
if they are set.

* Container name must have a tag specified (eg. `nfcore/pipeline:version`)
* Container tag / `$TRAVIS_TAG` must contain only numbers and dots
* Tags and `$TRAVIS_TAG` must all match one another

## Error #8 - Conda environment tests ## {#8}

> These tests only run when your pipeline has a root file called `environment.yml`

* The environment `name` must match the pipeline name and version
  * The pipeline name is defined in the config variable `manifest.name`
  * Replace the slash with a hyphen as environment names shouldn't contain that character
  * Example: For `nf-core/test` version 1.4, the conda environment name should be `nf-core-test-1.4`

Each dependency is checked using the [Anaconda API service](https://api.anaconda.org/docs).
Dependency sublists are ignored with the exception of `- pip`: these packages are also checked
for pinned version numbers and checked using the [PyPI JSON API](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPIJSON).

Note that conda dependencies with pinned channels (eg. `conda-forge::openjdk`) are fine
and should be handled by the linting properly.

Each dependency can have the following lint failures and warnings:

* (Test failure) Dependency does not have a pinned version number, eg. `toolname=1.6.8`
* (Test failure) The package cannot be found on any of the listed conda channels (or PyPI if `pip`)
* (Test failure) The package version cannot be found on anaconda cloud (or on PyPi, for `pip` dependencies)
* (Test warning) A newer version of the package is available

> NB: Conda package versions should be pinned with one equals sign (`toolname=1.1`), pip with two (`toolname==1.2`)

## Error #9 - Dockerfile for use with Conda environments ## {#9}

> This test only runs if there is both `environment.yml`
> and `Dockerfile` present in the workflow.

If a workflow has a conda `environment.yml` file (see above), the `Dockerfile` should use this
to create the container. Such `Dockerfile`s can usually be very short, eg:

```Dockerfile
FROM nfcore/base:1.7
MAINTAINER Rocky Balboa <your@email.com>
LABEL authors="your@email.com" \
    description="Docker image containing all requirements for the nf-core mypipeline pipeline"

COPY environment.yml /
RUN conda env create -f /environment.yml && conda clean -a
RUN conda env export --name nf-core-mypipeline-1.0 > nf-core-mypipeline-1.0.yml
ENV PATH /opt/conda/envs/nf-core-mypipeline-1.0/bin:$PATH
```

To enforce this minimal `Dockerfile` and check for common copy+paste errors, we require
that the above template is used.
Failures are generated if the `FROM`, `COPY` and `RUN` statements above are not present.
These lines must be an exact copy of the above example.

Note that the base `nfcore/base` image should be tagged to the most recent release.
The linting tool compares the tag against the currently installed version.

Additional lines and different metadata can be added without causing the test to fail.

## Error #10 - Template TODO statement found ## {#10}

The nf-core workflow template contains a number of comment lines with the following format:

```groovy
// TODO nf-core: Make some kind of change to the workflow here
```

This lint test runs through all files in the pipeline and searches for these lines.

## Error #11 - Singularity file found ##{#11}

As we are relying on [Docker Hub](https://https://hub.docker.com/) instead of Singularity and all containers are automatically pulled from there, repositories should not have a `Singularity` file present.

## Error #12 - Pipeline name ## {#12}

In order to ensure consistent naming, pipeline names should contain only lower case, alphabetical characters. Otherwise a warning is displayed.
